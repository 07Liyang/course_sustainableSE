# Sustainable Software Engineering ðŸŒ±
CS4415 | Edition of 2021/22

[Delft University of Technology] || [MSc in Computer Science â€“ Software Technology]


**Sustainable Software Engineering** is an overarching discipline that addresses the long-term consequences of designing, building, and releasing a software project.
By definition, sustainability covers five main perspectives: **environmental**, **social**, **individual**, economic, technical.
This course focuses on the first three.

Software Engineering (SE) has long addressed sustainability by **narrowing it down to economic and technical sustainability**.
However, our society is facing major sustainability challenges that can no longer be overlooked by software engineers and computer scientists.
It was estimated that, **by 2040, the ICT sector will contribute to 14% of the global carbon footprint**. Hence, environmental, social, and individual ought to be part of the equation when it comes to design, build, and release software systems.
The problem is far from simple, but **we need expert computer scientists** to bring sustainability into the core values of the next generation of tech-leading organisations.

This course will cover a set of competencies needed to leverage sustainable software systems.
It will have a **strong component on Green SE**, covering techniques to measure and improve the energy-efficiency at any stage of the software lifecycle.
Students will learn about **state-of-the-art practices on energy efficiency** and apply them in real software projects. Moreover, the course will cover core principles of **empirical software engineering**, and **social and individual sustainability**.

## Assignments

Below the description of each projects and respective formative[^formative] and summative[^summative] assessments.

### Project 1 â€“ Measuring Software Energy Consumption

Measure the energy consumption of a particular use case of an open source software system.
In this project, you will use state-of-the-art power measurement measurement tools: Intel Power Gadget, RAPL, PowerLog, PowerStat, Windows E3, and so on.

**Formative assessment:** Short meeting with the teacher to present preliminary results. You will receive written feedback to incorporate into a final report.

**Summative assessment:** Write a one-page report about the measurement experiment.

### Project 2 â€“ Research Project

**Formative assessment:** Short meeting with the teacher to present preliminary results. You will receive written feedback to incorporate into a final report.

**Summative assessment:** Write a short paper about the work and . Give a 15-min live talk to the class.
