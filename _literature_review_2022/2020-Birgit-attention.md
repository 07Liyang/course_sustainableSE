  Software engineers are plagued by the same troubles as many others in highly skilled jobs and digitized environments: Ever-expanding to-do lists, time to market pressure from management, deadline-driven development, continuous interruption during working tasks, and the juggle of balancing that with other areas of life (physical, mental and emotional health, family, household, finance, friends, hobbies and community service). These demands of life in combination with a seemingly ever-increasing pace wear or burn out many people in the long run. Specifically, as software engineers, this also leads to decreased creativity and less efficiency in problem-solving. Generally offered solutions are reducing screen time and spending more time outdoors, both of which are hard to do within the work of a software engineer. On a meta level, if the developers of the systems that run most of our world do not develop individual sustainability with a balanced pace of life, that imbalance propagates into the systems we develop (similar to Conway's Law). We argue that mindfulness practices like yoga poses (asanas), breathing practices, and meditation exercises can help individually, and even more effectively in combination. In this exploratory paper, we discuss related work that explores the application of these mitigations in other application domains and propose a research agenda to explore their use within software engineering education and practice.
Engaging with mindfulness practices in the context of software engineering promises to enhance creativity and cognitive problem-solving skills, leading to more efficiency and effectiveness during software development and increased individual sustainability. This, in turn, leads to better team spirit as well as increased economic profit, both in terms of maintaining human capital and customer contract deliverables

  Nowadays, success in the software industry often requires not only quality but also high speed of software delivery. These demands translate into the work of software engineers in form of hard deadlines, pressure to deliver to market on time and the ever-increasing pace of development. The associated pressure negatively impacts both the engineer’s productivity and their healthy distribution of energy and time among different areas of life.

The problem lies in the unsustainable working style. In highly productive economies, double-booking and over-scheduling have become typical practices in many fields. This includes the software industry, where “fast” is synonymous with “successful”. Consequentially, an unhealthy social norm has developed in programming communities where engineers consider it “a badge of honour” to trade their night sleep for more work and thus deliver faster.

As a consequence, software engineers are more likely to develop health problems such as cancer in the long run. This also indirectly causes economic losses estimated between $280 and $411 billion for the US in 2020 alone. The work-related stress also puts them at risk of experiencing burn-outs and decreased creativity. An associated social risk is the propagation of institutional structure into an organisation’s products - in this case, the software. Consequentially, the lack of individual sustainability of software engineers propagates through the products to users, possibly hindering their ability to exhibit a more sustainable behaviour. 

To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes an investigation into using mindfulness in software engineering education and practice to improve individual sustainability. Taking breaks to practice mindfulness through yoga, meditation and guided breathing improves physical and mental health, as well as creativity. Combination of these methods is thought to improve individual sustainability, as it improves self-respect and physical and mental wellbeing.

The research agenda starts by proposing a preliminary survey to gather opinions of software engineers on mindfulness interventions. Based on the survey data, narratives are developed to attract interested engineers, by for example explaining how yoga boosts their creativity in problem-solving. 

In terms of actual practice, in-class and in-workplace interventions would be devised, where instructions would be given out to participants on how to engage. Feedback and progress of users would be tracked with surveys and biometry over longer periods of time. 

Regarding tools to use, an illustrated card deck with 5-minute interventions and their benefits would be developed, both physically and as a mobile application. Next tool would be a practitioner toolkit composed of short instructional video series, which would help evaluate the effects of practicing mindfulness in a dedicated self-care room at work versus self-guided practice. Finally, a framework based on this data would be developed with interventions tailored to a particular organisation.

Finally, a way to properly time the interventions would be determined such that it does not interrupt productive thinking. This would be done with research into sensing and measuring indicators of thinking processes, such as eye tracking, sitting time or keyboard tapping speed.
